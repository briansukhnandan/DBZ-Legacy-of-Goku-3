# This is a project for the Queens College Game Development Club #
- This project was created with Unity and is my first attempt at making a playable game with it.
- The game is available to play on both Windows (only tested in a VM so far) and Linux (I've tested on Ubuntu 18.04, Manjaro xfce, and Arch and had solid results).


# To play on Linux: #
- Just run Release_1_0.x86 in the Club-Project directory (run a chmod +x): 
- Execute cd ~/dbz-log-3/Club-Project/ && ./Release_1_0.x86 in a terminal (where ~ is the dir you cloned to and (x) is the current version in the repo).
				  

# To play on Windows: # 
- Enter ~/dbz-log-3/Club-Project/Release_1_x_Windows/ (where ~ is the directory you cloned to).
- Run Club-Project.exe.
